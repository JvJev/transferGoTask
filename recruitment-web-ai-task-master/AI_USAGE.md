# AI Tools Usage Documentation

In this file, please describe the situations and ways in which you used AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, v0.dev) while working on this task.

## Code Analysis

*(Example: I used ChatGPT to explain how the `getStaticProps` function works in Next.js.)*

## Debugging and Bug Fixing

*(Example: I solved the grid responsiveness issue after consulting with an AI about the `grid-template-columns` property in CSS Grid.)*

## New Feature Implementation

*(Example: I asked GitHub Copilot to generate the boilerplate for a JavaScript function that sorts an array of objects.)*
